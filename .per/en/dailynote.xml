Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen. Today I'm going to talk about discover yourself. Ever since the accelerated development of
human civilization, perpetual sceintific discoveries of nature had accompanied mankind, all along the journey. It was discovering
the world around us that human beings have been able lead a more sophisticated life. However, as G.K Chesterton once said: 
One may understand the cosmos but never the ego. The self is more distant than any star. Thus our life is a journey of unrelenting
efforts to discover more of ourselves. Thank you.

Chandler & Monica Wedding:(end of season 7)

Joey: 	  Dearly beloved, I¡¯m sorry I¡¯m a little late. You may be confused by this now, but you won¡¯t be 
		  Memorial Day weekend 2002. Well, let¡¯s get started before the groom takes off again. Huh? We are 
		  gathered here today, to join this man and this woman in the bonds of holy matrimony. I¡¯ve known 
		  Monica and Chandler for a long time, and I can not imagine two people are more perfect for each other.
		  And now, as I¡¯ve left my notes in my dressing room. We shall proceed to the vows. Monica?
Monica:	  Chandler, For so long I... I wondered if I would ever find my prince, my soul mate. Then three 
		  years ago, at another wedding I turned to a friend for comfort. And in stead, I found everything 
		  that I¡¯d ever been looking for my whole life. And now... here we are... with our future before us,
		  and I only want to spend it with you, My prince, My soul mate, My friend. Unless you don¡¯t want to.
		  You go!
Chandler: Monica I thought this was going to be the most difficult thing I ever gonna had to do. But 
		  when I saw you walking down that aisle I realized how simple it was. I love you. Any surprises 
		  that come our way it¡¯s okay, because I will always love you. You are the person I was meant to 
		  spend the rest of my life with. You wanna know if I¡¯m sure?
Joey:	  You may not kiss the bride. So, I guess by the powers vested in my by the state of New York and 
		  the Internet guys, I now pronounce you husband and wife. Oh wait!Do you take each other?
Chandler: I do.
Monica:	  I do.
Joey:	  Yeah you do! uh...uh let¡¯s-let¡¯s do the rings. Once again, I pronounce you husband and wife. 
		  Now kiss her again.

------------------------------------------------------------

	Well it¡¯s just while Monica and I were dancing to them it was the first time I knew 
that you were the woman I wanted to dance all my dances with.

Chandler Propose:
	Chandler, In all my life, I never thought I would be so lucky. As to fall in love with my best, my best...
There¡¯s a reason why girls don¡¯t do this!

	Okay! Okay! Okay! Oh God, I thought, Wait a minute, I-I can do this. I thought that it mattered 
what I said or where I said it. Then I realized the only thing that matters is that you, you make me 
happier than I ever thought I could be. And if you¡¯ll let me, I will spend the rest of my life trying 
to make you feel the same way. Monica, will you marry me?

	Yes. I knew you were likely to take a wife!

for in the due of little things the heart finds it¡¯s morning and is refreshed."

Lamar Odom 2010 Lakers Champion Ring Ceremony's Speech:
	I usually get nervous when I have to talk in front of people, but tonight I feel like I¡¯m at home. 
It helps, because the next person I¡¯m about to bring out I¡¯ve known since I was 12 years old. When we were 12 years old, 
he was really quiet, and now he takes his clothes off on Jimmy Kimmel and he raps. But there¡¯s nobody like him. 
I can¡¯t say enough about him. We come from the same family tree in New York City of basketball, and I just want him 
to know that his family is proud of him. The one and only, Ron Artest.

chelsea's big interview special

Someone¡¯s watching over me
Found myself today
Oh I found myself and run away
Something pulled me back
The voice of reason I forgot I had
All I know is just you¡¯re not here to say
What you always used to say

But it¡¯s written in the sky tonight
So I won¡¯t give up
No, I won¡¯t break down
Sooner than it seems life turns around
And I will be strong
Even if it all goes wrong
When I am standing in the dark I¡¯ll still believe
Someone¡¯s watching over me

Seen that ray of light
And it¡¯s shining on my destiny
Shining all the time
And I won't be afraid
To follow everywhere it¡¯s take me
All I know is yesterday is gone
And right now I belong
Took this moment to my dreams

So I won't give up
No I won¡¯t break down
 Sooner than it seems life turns around
And I will be strong
Even if it all goes wrong
When I¡¯m standing in the dark I¡¯ll still believe
Someone¡¯s watching over me
It doesn¡¯t matter what people say
And it doesn't matter how long it takes
Believe in yourself and you will fly high
And it only matters how true you are
Be true to yourself and follow your heart

So I won¡¯t give up
And I won¡¯t break down
Sooner than it seems life turn around
And I will be strong
Even if it all goes wrong
When I ¡®m standing in the dark, I¡¯ll still believe
Then I won't give up
No I won't break down
Sooner than it seems life turn around

And I will be strong 
Even if it all goes wrong
When I¡¯m standing in the dark I¡¯ll still believe
That someone¡¯s watching over me
Someone¡¯s watching over me
Someone¡¯s watching over me
Someone¡¯s watching over me

Nothing in the world
It¡¯s been so long I can¡¯t remember when
We didn¡¯t care how deep it was we dived right in
Watching everything around us disappear
Oh I¡¯ve missed you here

And it seems the little things get in the way
We¡¯re so caught up in routine from day to day
Sometimes it feels like we¡¯re not anchored anywhere
Oh I¡¯ve missed you yeah
So tell me there¡¯s nothing in the world
That could ever come between us
Show me your not afraid tonight Baby make me believe
That there¡¯s nothing in the world
That could ever 
Steal the moment from right here and now
Nothing
In the world

Two shadows falling back together now
Baby we¡¯ve spent too much time just hiding out
And there¡¯s nowhere that I¡¯d rather be than here
Cos I¡¯ve missed you yeah
So tell me there¡¯s nothing in the world
That could ever come between us
Show me your not afraid tonight Baby make be believe
That there¡¯s nothing in the world
That could ever
Steal the moment from right here and now
Nothing
In the world
Nothing in the world
There¡¯s nothing in the world
So tell me there¡¯s nothing in the world
That could ever come between us
Show me your not afraid tonight Baby make believe

Steal the moment from right here and now
Nothing
So tell me there¡¯s nothing in the world
That could ever come between us
Show me your not afraid tonight Baby make me believe
That there¡¯s nothing in the world 

Hold it against me
Hey over there
Please forgive me
If I¡¯m coming on too strong
Hate to stare
But you¡¯re wining 
And they¡¯re playing my favorite song
So come here
A little close
Wanna whisper in your ear
Make it clear
Little question
Wanna  know just how you feel
If I said my heart was beating loud
If we could escape the crowd somehow
If I said I want your body now
Would you hold it against me
Cause you feel like paradise
And I need a vacation tonight
So if I said I want your body now
Would you hold it against me
Hey you might think
That I¡¯m crazy
But I know I¡¯m just your type
 I¡¯m be a little crazy
But you just cannot deny
There¡¯s spark in between us
When we¡¯re dancing on the floor
I want more
Wanna see it
So I¡¯m asking you tonight
If I said my heart was beating loud
If we could escape the crowd somehow
If I said I want your body now
Would you hold it against me
Cause you feel like paradise
And I need a vacation tonight
So if I said I want your body now
Would you hold it against me
If I said I want your body now
Would you hold it against me?
Gimme something good
Don't  wanna wait I want it now 
Pop it like a hood
And show how you work it out
If I said my heart was beating loud
If I said I want your body now 
Would you hold it against me
If I said my heart was beating loud
If we could escape the crowd somehow
If I said I want your body now
Would you hold it against me
Cause you feel like paradise
I need a vacation tonight
So if I said I want your body now 
Would you hold it against me

Lakers Back to Back Championships last Year
	Back to back championships in the league we know how hard that is to go through all that. And it speaks a lot of 
our team, our character. 
	¡°By going through the season, every single series in the playoffs, we had to fight and battle, complete extremely hard. 
When you¡¯re able to overcome all those obstacles, you get stronger and stronger. ¡± GASOL said.
	¡°When you want to be champions or you wanna repeat that champions, there comes a moment where you figure out just about 
you and your team. And that¡¯s it.¡± FISHER said.
	¡°One thing that always brought us together is our team chemistry, we always found the way in difficult times when our 
backs against the wall, to come out winning.¡± Vujacic said.
	¡°To be Laker and to be part of the organization is amazing, every game every day fight for a championship, 
it¡¯s extremely special.¡± FARMAR said.
	¡°This is a storied franchise, and they¡¯ve always been dominant, and obviously winning these championships, and been in the 
Finals 3 straight years. There are things that¡¯ll be in history books. And I¡¯m fortunate for that. ¡± BYNUM said.
	¡°Basketball is the first thing that I ever fell in love with, 30 years old I¡¯m playing, since I was 5 or 6, to win 
2 NBA titles with the L.A Lakers, it¡¯s been an incredible journey for me.¡± ODOM said.
	¡°It seems like flash back all years, and I¡¯ve been in the league everything just seems like a blur. And you find yourself 
here in the moment and realize the significance of it and the importance of it. It¡¯s dream come true. ¡± BRYANT said.
	It¡¯s an eternal moment in their storied history. The Los Angeles Lakers have captured their 2nd straight world championship, 
and etched their names into Lakers¡¯ law.

Chaos Theory:  
	It has been said that something as small as the flutter of a butterfly¡¯s wing can ultimately cause a typhoon halfway around 
the world.
			
Butterfly Effect:			
	The butterfly effect is a metaphor that encapsulates the concept of sensitive dependency on initial conditions in Chaos theory; 
namely, a small change at one place in a complex system can have large effects elsewhere. Although this may appear to be an 
esoteric and unusual behavior, it is exhibited by very simple systems: for example: a ball placed at the crest of a hill might 
roll into any of several valleys depending on slight differences in initial position. The butterfly effect is a common trope 
in fiction when presenting scenarios involving time travel with ¡°what if¡± cases where one storyline diverges at the moment of 
a seemingly minor event resulting in two significantly different outcomes.

Sprite has invited two superstars from East and West as spokesman.

	How do you feel about your collaboration with Jay Chou?
	
Kobe: You know it¡¯s fine, I kinda got a taste of his world. And he got a taste of mine.

	How do you comment him as a basketball player?
	
Kobe: He wasn¡¯t bad. You know he had little moves going around his back. Going between his legs, and he had all the fancy stuff. 
	  And he can shoot too, so he wasn¡¯t bad. 
	  
	Jay really wants to say something to you.

Jay Chou: Hi, Kobe, it¡¯s me, Jay Chou. I¡¯m thrilled to work with Kobe on this Sprite TVC. It¡¯s really awesome, especially 
		  playing basketball in front of Kobe. I believe it¡¯s many people¡¯s dream. It¡¯s impossible to score playing against him. 
		  And this Sprite TVC is really creative, which is ... After a sip of Sprite, sparks creativity. And then use the thrust 
		  on the skateboard. Slump dunk in front of him, which is really unbelievable. The more impossible it¡¯s more amazing. 
		  I think this TVC is really exciting. And of course, I worked with Kobe on a song. The melody and lyrics were done 
		  in one go. With the two of us joining force, we¡¯re invincible and out of the world. I trust that you¡¯ll enjoy this TVC 
		  and the theme song. And I¡¯d make s suggestion to Kobe, listen to my songs when you¡¯re bored, relieve the pre-game 
		  jitters. I¡¯ve plenty of fast songs, and slow songs. That doesn¡¯t matter, I hope to have another chance to play 
		  basketball with you. See you. 
		  
	How do you look your own performance?

Kobe: I did a great job,  I give myself a A+.

	Kobe and Jay also care a lot about those kids who live in the underprivileged areas. We know that you have already both 
decided to do something good, so what is it that you can share with us?

Kobe: The proceeds are, the ringtones from the song, will be going into Project Hope. Just to help build basketball courts 
	  in underprivileged China. And to provide them with a quick learn about sport, leadership, camaraderie, and things in 
	  that nature. And that¡¯s what we¡¯re gonna do.

Mark: Did you know there are more people with genius IQ living in China than there are people of any kind living in the 
	  United States?
Erica: That can¡¯t possibly be true.
Mark: It is true.
Erica: What would account for that?
Mark: Well first of all, a lot of people live in China. But here is my question: how do you distinguish yourself in a 
	  population of people who all got 1600 on their SAT¡¯s?
Erica: I didn¡¯t know they take SAT in China.
Mark: They don¡¯t, I wasn¡¯t talking about China anymore, I was talking about me.
Erica: You got 1600?
Mark: Yes. I can sing in a Accapella group. But I can¡¯t sing.
Erica: Does that mean that you actually got nothing wrong?
Mark: Or you row crew or you invent a 25 dollar PC.
Erica: Or you get into a final club
Mark: Or you get into a final club, exactly.
Erica: You know from a woman¡¯s perspective sometimes not being in an Accapella group can be a good thing.
Mark: This is serious.
Erica: Well I am admitting I do like guys who row crew.
Mark: Well I can¡¯t do that.
Erica: I was kidding.
Mark: Yes. I got nothing wrong on the test.
Erica: Have you ever tried?
Mark: I am trying now.
Erica: To row crew?
Mark: To get into a final club. To row crew? No. Are you, like-whatever-delusional?
Maybe just sometimes. Sometimes, you say two things at once, and I¡¯m not sure which one we¡¯re aiming at.
Mark: But you¡¯ve seen guys who row crew, right?
Erica: No.
Mark: Okay, well, they are bigger than me. They¡¯re the world class athletes. And a second ago you said you like guys who 
	  row crew, so I assumed you¡¯d met once.
Erica: I guess I meant I liked the idea of it. The way a girl likes cowboys.
Mark: Okay.
Erica: Should we get something to eat?
Mark: Would you rather talk about something else?
Erica: No, it¡¯s just that since the beginning of the conversation about finals clubs I think I may have missed a birthday. 
	   There are more people in China with genius IQ than the entire population of ¡­?
Mark: The Phoenix is the most diverse. The Fly Club, Roosevelt punched the Porc.
Erica: Which one?
Mark: The porcelain, the Proc, it¡¯s the best of the best.
Erica: Which Roosevelt?
Mark: Theodore.
Erica: Is it true they send a bus around to pick up girls who want to party with the next chairman?
Mark: You can see why it¡¯s so important to get in.
Erica: Okay, well, which is the easiest one to get into?
Mark: Why would you ask me that?
Erica: I was just asking.
Mark: None of them. That¡¯s the point. Our friend Eduardo made $300, 000 betting on oil future last summer and Eduardo won¡¯t 
	  come close to getting in. the ability to make money doesn¡¯t impress anybody around here.
Erica: Must be nice. He made $ 300, 000 in a summer?
Mark: He likes Meteorology.
Erica: I thought it was oil futures.
Mark: You can read the weather, you can predict the price of heating oil. I think you asked me that because you think the 
	  final club that¡¯s easiest to get into is the one where I¡¯ll have the best chance.
Erica: I ¡­ what?
Mark: You asked me which one was the easiest to get into because you think that¡¯s where I have the best chance.
Erica: The one that¡¯s easiest to get into would be the one where anybody had the best chance.
Mark: You didn¡¯t ask which one was the best one, you asked me which one was the easiest.
Erica: I was honestly just asking. Okay? I was asking just to ask. Mark, I¡¯m not speaking in code. 
Mark: Erica.
Erica: You¡¯re obsessed with the finals clubs. You have finals clubs OCD and you need to see someone about this, who¡¯ll prescribe 
	   some sort of medication. You don¡¯t care if side effects may include blindness,
Mark: Final clubs, not finals clubs. And there¡¯s a difference between being obsessed and being motivated.
Erica: Yes. There is.
Mark: Well, what you do, that was cryptic, so you do speak in code.
Erica: I didn¡¯t mean to be cryptic.
Mark: All I¡¯m saying I need to do something substantial in order to get the attention of the clubs.
Erica: Why?
Mark: Because they are exclusive. And fun and they lead me to a better life.
Erica: You think Teddy Roosevelt got elected president because he was a member of the Phoenix Club?
Mark: He was a member of the Procellian and yes he did.
Erica: Well why don¡¯t you concentrate on being the best you, you can be.
Mark: Did you really just say that?
Erica: I was kidding. I¡¯m just stating the fact and that doesn¡¯t make it any less true.
Mark: I want to be straight forward and tell you that I think you should be a lot more supportive. If I get in I¡¯ll be taking 
	  you to the events and the gatherings, and you¡¯ll be meeting people that you wouldn¡¯t normally get to meet.
Erica: You would do that for me?
Mark: Indeed.
Erica: Okay I want to try and be straight forward with you, and let you know that were not anymore.
Mark: What do you mean?
Erica: We were not dating anymore, I¡¯m sorry.
Mark: Is this a joke?
Erica: No, it¡¯s not.
Mark: You¡¯re breaking up with me?
Erica: You¡¯re going to introduce me to people I wouldn¡¯t normally get to meet? What the fuck is that supposed to mean?
Mark: Settle down.
Erica: What was it supposed to mean?
Mark: Erica, the reason we¡¯re  able to sit here and drink is that you used to sleep with door guy.
Erica: The door guy, his name is Bobby, I haven¡¯t slept with the door guy, the door guy is a friend of mine. He is a perfectly 
	   good class of people, and what part of Long-lsland are you from? Wimbledon?
Mark: Wait.
Erica: I¡¯m going back to my dorm.
Mark: Wait, wait.
Erica: Yes.
Mark: Is that real?
Erica: Yes.
Mark: Then wait, I apologize, okay?
Erica: I have to go¡­
Mark: Erica?
Erica: Yes.
Mark: I am sorry and I mean it¡­
Erica: I appreciate that but I have to study.
Mark: Come on, you don¡¯t have to study. You don¡¯t have to study. Let¡¯s just  talk.
Erica: I can¡¯t.
Mark: Why?
Erica: Because it¡¯s exhausting. Dating you like dating a stairmaster.
Mark: All I meant is that you¡¯re not likely to¡­ currently, I wasn¡¯t making an comment on your parents. I  was saying you go to 
	  B.U. I was stating a fact. That¡¯s all. If you think I am rude.
Erica: I have to go to study.
Mark: You don¡¯t have to study.
Erica: Why do you keep saying I don¡¯t have to study?
Mark: Because you got to B.U. Would you get some food?
Erica: I¡¯m sorry you¡¯re not sufficiently impressed with my education.
Mark: And I¡¯m sorry I don¡¯t have a rowboat. So were even.
Erica: I think we should just be friends.
Mark: Friends?
Erica: I was being polite, I had no intention of being friends with you.
Mark: I¡¯m under some press right now from my O.S class. If we could just order some food, I think we should¡­
Erica: Listen, you¡¯re probably going to be a very successful computer person. But you¡¯re going to go through life thinking that 
	   girls don¡¯t like you because you¡¯re a nerd. And I want you to know, from the bottom of my heart, that won¡¯t be true. 
	   It¡¯ll be because you¡¯re an asshole.

English Patient's Story:
	The King insisted that he would find some way to prove beyond dispute that his wife was fairest of all women. 
¡°I will hide you in your room where we sleep,¡± said Candaules . Candaules tells Gyges that the Queen has the same practice 
every night. She takes off her clothes and puts them on the chair by the door to her room. And from where you stand, 
you will be able to gaze on her at your leisure. And that evening, it¡¯s exactly as the King has told him. She goes to the chair, 
removes her clothes one by one, until she¡¯s standing naked in full view of Gyges. And indeed, she was more lovely than 
he could have imagined. But then, the Queen looked up, and saw Gyges concealed in the shadows. And although she said nothing, 
she shuddered. And the next day, she sends for, for Gyges and challenged him. And hearing his story, this is what she said. 
She said, ¡°Either you must submit to death for gazing on that which you should not, or else kill my husband who has shamed me, 
and become King in his place.¡± So Gyges kill the King, marries the Queen and becomes ruler of Lydia for 28 years. 

-------------------------------------------------------------------------

HERO
There¡¯s a hero
If you look inside your heart
You don¡¯t have to afraid
Of what you are
There¡¯s an answer
If you reach into your soul
And the sorrow that you know
Will melt away
And then a hero comes along
With the strength to carry on
And you cast your fairs aside
And you know you can survive
So when you feel like hope is gone
Look inside you and be strong
And you¡¯ll finally see the truth
That a hero lies in you
It¡¯s a long road
When you face the world along
 No one reachs out a hand
For you to hold
You can find love
If you search within yourself
And the emptiness you felt
Will disappear
And then a hero comes along
With the strength to carry on
 And you cast your fears aside
And you know you can survive
So when you fell like hope is gone
Look inside you and be strong
And you¡¯ll finally see the truth
That a hero lies in you
Lord knows
Dreams are hard to follow
But don¡¯t let anyone tear them away
There will be tomorrow
In time
You¡¯ll find the way
And then hero comes along
With the strength to carry on
And you cast your fears aside
And you know you can survive
So when you feel like hope is gone
Look inside you and be strong
And you¡¯ll finally see the truth
That a hero lies in you
That a hero lies in you 

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

A Gift
	Imagine, if you will, a gift. I¡¯d like for you to picture in your mind. It¡¯s not too big. About a size of a golf ball, 
so in vision what it looks like all wrapped up. But before I show you what¡¯s inside, I will tell you that¡¯s going to do 
incredible things for you. It will bring all of your family together. You will feel loved and appreciated like never before. 
And reconnect to friends and acquaintances you haven¡¯t heard from in years. Adoration and admiration will overwhelm you. 
It will recalibrate what¡¯s important in your life. It will redefine your sense of spirituality and faith. 
You will have a new understanding and trust in your body. You will have unsurpassed vitality and energy. 
You will expand your vocabulary, meet new people, and you¡¯ll have a healthier lifestyle. And get this, you¡¯ll have 
an eight-week vacation of doing absolutely nothing. You¡¯ll eat gourmet meal. Flowers will arrive by the truck load. 
People will say to you: ¡°You look great! Have you had any work done?¡± And you¡¯ll have a life-time supply of good drugs. 
You¡¯ll be challenged, inspired, motivated and humbled. Your life will have new meaning: peace, health, serenity, happiness, 
nirvana. The price? Fifty-five thousand dollars. And that¡¯s an incredible deal. By now, I know you¡¯re dying to know what 
it is and where you can get one. Does Amazon carry it? Does it have the Apple logo on it? Is there a waiting list? Not likely. 
This gift came to me about five months ago. And looked more like this when it was all wrapped up. Not quite so pretty. And this. 
And then this. It was a rare jam. A brain tumor, Hemangioblastoma. The gift that keeps on giving. And while I¡¯m ok now. 
I wouldn¡¯t wish this gift for you. I¡¯m not sure you¡¯d want it. But I wouldn¡¯t  change my experience. 
It profoundly altered my life in ways it didn¡¯t expect. In all the ways I just shared  with you. So the next time you 
are faced with something that¡¯s unexpected, unwanted and uncertain. Consider, that it just may be a gift.  

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------   

You¡¯re nice, classy. You don¡¯t even seem like a whore.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Match Point:
	The man who said, ¡°I¡¯d rather be lucky than good,¡± saw deeply into life. People are afraid to face how great a part of life 
is dependent on luck. It¡¯s scary to think so much is out of one¡¯s control. There are moments in a match when the ball hits 
the top of the net, and for a split second it can either go forward or fall back. With a little luck, it goes forward and you win. 
Or maybe it doesn¡¯t, and you lose.

	From now on, you¡¯ll be on a journey between who you think you are and who you can be. The key is to allow yourself 
to continue the journey in the ocean of books. And I do lean a lot from books: geometry of Euclid, logic of Aristotle, 
fable of Aesop known to children around the world. Well, no offense to all those great authors of the books, but during 
my three years at my university, I do realize that the personal experience though practice means more to me. 
As we are in this global information age where both economic growth and individual opportunity are based on ideas, 
a commitment to providing all human beings the golden opportunity to develop themselves is so vital, not only people here, 
but all around. As we are in this transformation age where communications and commerce are global, investments are mobile, 
technology is almost magical, and the ambition for a better life is now universal, and I think this is why we are here today. 
We want to earn our personal experience through practicing our oral English, sharing our opinions of tourism and ecology 
with all the judges and audience here. And I think we are so lucky to be alive at this moment of the history. 
Never before have our nation enjoyed so much prosperity and so much social progress with so little internal crises. 
And never before have our young people had so much great opportunity to practice ourselves and, therefore, have a profound 
obligation to build a more perfect nation of our ancestor¡¯s dream. And I think our government had provided us young people 
with tools and condition to build the future of our dreams. Even we know some rules, some regulations, 
or experiences from our books, we still simply cannot graft it onto today¡¯s busier, more impersonal, complicated world. 
Instead, our challenges is to arrive at a consensus values and common vision of what we can do today individually and collectively 
to build a strong family and strong community, and above all, make the world the better place for us to live. Thank you very much.

Love Poem:

I love you not only for what you are, But for what I am when I am with you;

I love you not only for what you have made of yourself, But for what you are making of me;

I love you for the part of me that you bring out.

I love you for putting your hand into my heaped-up hear and passing over.

All the foolish weak things that you can't help dimly seeing there

And for drawing out into the light all the beautiful belongings

I love you because you are helping me to make of the lumber of my life.

You do not put me on the road as the inn but your heart devout temple.

That no one else had looked quite far enough to find, So no one found my beautiful, because no one been here.

We will be happy as long as we love

Happiness being on the promises made in

Happiness in the dream of the future

Guanghong/Zhiqi,

I hope you had a good Chinese New Year, welcome back.

Hopefully you are looking forward to coming to the UK next week for 2 week.

Just to let you know we have arranged for a driver to meet you at the Airport on Sunday and take you to the apartments.  The driver will be waiting just the other side of customs, so please look out for him, he should have a card with your names on or maybe saying TIBCO.

The driver will take you to the apartment and hopefully will take you in and help you pick up the keys.  The apartment is in the same place as Xiaolei stayed when he came over last year, so you might want to ask him about it and he can give you some advice about places to eat and buy food etc.

I will pick you up and take you into the office on Monday morning, I will meet you in the reception area at 9am, so please get there a few minutes before.

I am free Monday/Tuesday and Wednesday evening, I was planning to take you back on Monday night and if needed I can take you to the food shops if you want to get some shopping.  I was planning to also take you out for a meal one evening and again (probably on the Wednesday night with Paul and Howard who will be doing the training/hand over).

I won¡¯t make any firm arrangements for Monday night at this point as it will depend how tied you are from the trip, but if you would like to we can go out either Monday or Tuesday.

Once we get into the office on Monday morning you will have about 45mins to settle in, such as connect up your laptop etc.  The training is scheduled to start at 10am on Monday and run for all of the first week.

The second week will be more hands on project work and building etc.

I will be sending out a separate e-mail with the agenda for the first week as well as some pre-requisties and reading that you should try to do before you arrive.

You can contact me on +44 1626 332007 or +44 7769 724926, if you have any problems on Sunday, please call me and I will try to help you out.

Thanks
John B

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Guanghong/Zhiqi,

Please read this mail carefully and carry out as much as possible prior to your arrival in the UK. At the bottom of this e-mail is the outline agenda for the first weeks training sessions, this is probably likely to change slightly as we go through the week, but it¡¯s a good starting point.

Attached is a text file called prerequisites.txt, this file lists all the software that is needed to build and run the tech plug-ins.  If you could make sure you have plenty of space on your laptops and install all the software listed  in that file, including having an iPE installation of 11.1.2 for SQL server set up and running on the machine, with EMS and BW running and the tech plug-ins working.  Plus as much of the other requirements as you possibly can.  This can either be directly installed on the machine, or in a VMimage, although I suspect for performance reasons it would be better to have it directly on the machine.  It is not listed but you should also install Business Studio as the tech plug-ins modules for that will be covered on the training course.

We will have some time to sort out any setup issues, but the more that you have done before arriving the more time we will have to actually cover training and the handover.

Also please take time to read through the Install and User guides for the Tech plug-ins, Workspace plug-ins including POJO, EAI Java and BW Connector.  I have also attached a ZIP file called CDC.zip, which includes some technical documentation, which will be covered during next week, if you could read that before coming it will be good preparation for the hand over.

There is a lot to get done here, and I appreciate that you might not be able to get all the software installed and working and read all the documentation, therefore it is important to balance between the two things, if not everything is working that is not a problem, but you must set aside some time before arriving to read the documentation material as that will be more valuable than just having the software installed.  Obviously if you have all the software installed and working and the documentation has been read then that is the best scenario, but you must read the documentation in advance of the trip.


Please could you send me the specification of your laptop, with the memory and amount of available disk space just so we can check that all is going to be OK before you arrive.


Ling,

Please allow Guanghong and Zhiqi as much time as possible to prepare for next week.

Thanks look forward to seeing you both next week.
John B

Guanghong/Zhiqi,

We have arrange a car to pick you up from the Paramount Apartments, where you are staying, as 1pm on Sunday to take you to the airport.

This should get you to the airport by around 2-2:30pm, which will give you around 3 hours at the airport, which should be plenty of time for you to check in, and to look around and do some shopping.

I assume you will meet the driver outside reception, like you have been meeting me.

Hope you have a good journey home.

John B

Hello All,
I just wanted to wish everyone a happy and prosperous Chinese New Year and hope that the year of the rabbit is good to all of us.  I was in Singapore and Malaysia last week and it is always fun to see all the excitement and preparation for the New Year.
Thank you all for the hard work this past year, it was a significant year for us as we reached our 5 year milestone at CDC and the CDC continues to play an important role in TIBCO¡¯s R&D.  I hope that everyone has a safe and enjoyable holiday with your families and I look forward to seeing you all soon.

With best wishes,
Fiona

Hi all,
 
I would like to take this chance to announce that Daniel Zeng has been formally promoted to manager TIBCO CDC, and he will take responsibilty to AMX extension(David's team), UDDI (Jean-Marie/Ping's team), COPS(Ani/Sunil's team) and BPEL(Alex/Hanyu's team). During the past 4 years, Daniel proved not only his technical talent, but also very comprehensive and promising management skills. His responsibilty and accountability are the key factor to the success of all the AMX Extension delivers, like Common Logging, JMS Appender, .Net/WFC container, Cookbook, Smartmapper and many other products not listed here. 
 
We would like to have Daniel take care of all the AMX related dev teams, thus we can expect to see better coorperation, resource leveraging, knowledge sharing among all the team. We do believe that Daniel can lead the AMX group in CDC to achieve great success.
 
Congratulations Daniel!
 
Thanks.

Dear all£¬

We will shutdown office during Christmas this year as previous two years, but not similar, we will work on several Saturdays: 12.3/12.10/12.17, and 2012.1.7/1.4, and we will take holiday on Tomb Sweeping Holiday/Labor Day/Dragon Boat Festival. Support is an exception. Some team members (e.g. BPM Dev & QA) will be exceptions if there is any specific working arrangement during Christmas.

Thx,
Jane

Subject: Migration Current Status

Hi, all
In accordance with the requirements of JASON, I give my task report today and I will do this continually from now, I think it¡¯s really a good habit to made me work more efficiently and effectively, lots of appreciates to Jason.

Sum up:
Migration is totally a new module, I do this from 0 code, the following table is the trace of migration from very beginning
Time period	Work
7.18 ¨C 7.22
7.25 ¨C 7.29
8.1 - 8.9
8.8 ¨C 8.12	The first version migration, use hibernate to persist data to new version database(this is a very wrong decision be proved be later performance test)
8.15 ¨C 8.20
8.22 ¨C 8.26	Base on fist version, modify some defects and do performance test(the result can¡¯t meet our request)
8.29 ¨C 9.2
9.5 ¨C 	Reconstructure the migration architecture base on the first version, user JDBC replace hibernate in new version data persist
This is a very outline summary, I hope u all can make sense, if u want know more detail design or implementation let me know and maybe we can discuss this face-to-face.

   Current Status:
Although the current migration can work well and the performance test result is under our expectation, but there still some task to do:
2.	Pagination query xml file(quite larger) from oracle xml database, for performance enhancement we must do this, and I am stuck by this question now and try to solve it right now(if u have some good advice PL tell me, appreciate in advance)
3.	Audit log migration, ¡®cause there really a bigger number of auditlogs in old version database(if a plan has 100 task, that means the plan has more than 100 audits in database), so query this data is really a big challenge, I will do this after completing pagination query.

That¡¯s all, thank for your attention and if you have any question tell me directly without any hesitation
 
  Nice Regards

Hi

I have roughly completed a new Technology installation, need to do some test.  Like test the conductor installation, we need to test on Weblogic 10.3, Weblogic 10.3.4, Jboss-eap-4.3, Jboss-eap-5.1 platform, both UI and Console mode in Windows system.

The installation image under ¡®\\192.168.68.116\ipc113-refered\image\wst¡¯

How to count the installation is successful?
      The best way to count this is run a case base on this new installation.
      If you have not enough time, the other equal way is to check the files Under IPE Node(which copied by installation), to make sure this files are copied correctly.

What¡¯s my main interest?
      I really want to a defects list after your have finished the test, this list should contain all defects you have found during the test.

That¡¯s all, much appreciate and have a great weekends

Regards

Hi, James

In accord with IPC 11.2.1 conductor release, Our Technology Plug-ins new released also need a new branch, base on this branch, we can do some changes to support the jboss-eap-5.1 and Weblogic 10.3.4.

Bellow is the trunk Revision number for last GA release of Tech Plug-Ins:
End Revision Number: 	82182 
Repository Path: 	https://emea-swi-ipesvn.emea.tibco.com/svn/iProcessSuite/trunk 


I¡¯m not sure exactly what additional information is required but I assume John will know it.

Hi, Paul
 
As far as I know, conductor use the EMS connection information while run Conductor in cluster mode, but this connection information can not capture during conductor server plug-ins (Orch and Order) installation. Usually we provide a document for Conductor cluster installation, this document including some step by step procudres to configure EMS conection infomation and jar file location.
 
By the way, I think this is a defectes of conductor server plug-ins(orch and order) installtion, although there is a EMS configure referenced UI exists, but it always can not work, it seems redundant in conductor server plug-ins installation.
 
I hope you can make sense, but if you have some question PL ask me directly without any hesitation.
 
Kind Regards
 
Zhiqi

Subject: Question about Conductor
Hi Zhiqi
 
I hope all is well with you since we last met in February.
 
I have a question about conductor.
 
When we install the Technology Plug-In we ask questions about EMS. Do the conductor server plug-ins (Orch and Order) in any way make use of the EMS information as captured during the installation process?
 
We ask the customer to enter information about how to connect to EMS. Do the conductor plug-ins reference this information either during installation or subsequently at runtime?
 
We also ask the customer where the EMS jar files are located. This information is used to copy the Jar files to their correct installed location.
 
My main interest lies in whether conductor uses the EMS connection information rather than the Jar file location.
 
Kind regards
 
Paul

I have done the following test for finding the problem and solving this issue:
 
I wrote a simple test class which has the same functionality as SWTestJMS¡¯s testConnection() method, initialize a JNDI context use Tibco EMS SSL connection referenced properties(client certificates, client identity, ssl password, etc). I run this class in 2 difference environment:
1.	Run this class on Solaris 10 directly, it works well, can look up EMS resource and send EMS message without any Exception.
2.	Run this class in our BWC run environment, still use JMS Administration Tool Test  Button invoke it. In this condition, it does not work well, the same error came out, it crashed while try to look up the  QueueConnectionFactory from EMS server, the phenomenon is very strange: While the lookup EMS resource code be triggered, it doesn¡¯t reply immediately, the app came to a stuck state,  after about 2 minutes the BG crashed,  in eaijava logs there is no any error trace, but in EMS server console there is a connection timeout warning as attached picture depicted.
 
Through this test, it seems it¡¯s our application¡¯s defects, I am confused is why lookup EMS resource can cause the system crush and we can¡¯t catch any Exception, I also think EMS support can help us.

Hi Paul
 
I spent time looking into SWTestJMS Class, I think the issue caused by executing SWTestJMS's line 314:
QueueConnectionFactory qcf = (QueueConnectionFactory) context.lookup(destinationVO.get_factory());
While this line be executed, a system error occured, what the system error can not be catched, that's why there is no error trace in JMX Server side log files and BG crashed, restarted.
The attach file is JMX Client Side Log, at the end of the file have some Server side error trace.
 
I think this 2 files(server_root.cert.pem,client_identity.p12) are the reason cause this issue on Solaris 10(Generic_142909-17), because JNDI Context contain this 2 file and the EOFException can be found in Client Side log.
 
I will still look into this issue tommorow, if you have some advice please feel free to tell me.
 
Nice Regards

I have reappeared this issue on Solaris 10(Generic_142909-17) .I also researched the eaijva logs and found that the log info doesn't correspond with code both in trunk and branch\02377_WST_11.3.0.x. I need the newest code to do some more detailed exploring.

Paul, Could you tell me your branch that CDC QA used? I need to add some logs or catch all Exception in SWTestMbean's testConnection Method.

Subject: FW: debug SSL issue on Solaris 10 with TP 11.3

Ling,

As part of the work on the new Tech Plug-in release that is going on in the UK, CDC QA have been performing the testing.  They have encountered a strange problem, whereby the Tech plug-ins which are built on Solaris 8 work fine when run on Solaris 10.  But the new 11.3 version is having the problem described below when run on Solaris 8.  We have confirmed that 3 Solaris 10 machines all work without issue.  But we have now seen 2 (maybe 3) instances where if crashes on Solaris 8.

As the Solaris 8 environment is in CDC and the engineer in the UK is also working hard to resolve other issues.

Please could you have either Guanhong or Zhiqi spend some time on Monday and Tuesday debugging the Solaris 8 environment with the aim of achieving 1 of the following objectives:-
        a) They find the problem and locate a fix, which can be passed back to the UK to be included in the final release
        b) They find a trigger that seems to be the cause of the problem but don't understand how that can be the problem or how to fix it.  We can then get together and determine next steps and maybe this will be enough for Paul Raby to determine what the problem is.
        c) We gather enough information to build a reproduction scenario such that we need to raise a support call with Oracle for either Solaris or Java.


Paul Raby,

Please can you reply to this e-mail with the necessary built information, in particular the branch and revision for the build that CDC are testing.

Ling,

By all means Guanghong or Zhiqi can checkout the code and make changes to investigate the issue, but these should be read only changes at this stage nothing should be checked back in, as this is a live working branch and without visibility of what is being changed a bad checkin could stall Paul for hours even a whole day.

Thanks
John B

Jobin,

I do have a couple of engineers in CDC that know this product and could investigate it. I am not sure if they know it well enough to resolve it, but it is a logical next step.

I will speak to Paul Raby later on about how practical that is and what information they will need, such as the specific check point the current builds from.

All being well, we should be able to get a CDC engineer look at this on Monday, and give them a couple of days to see if they can track down the issue.

How does that sound?

Hi Jobin,

We borrowed one Solaris10 box from IT, and set up the test environment as below:

iPE version: iPE11.3
DB version: Oracle Server and client 11.2.0.2
IPTP version: TP11.3a1
Machine info:  SunOS tibsol36 5.10 Generic_142909-17 sun4u sparc SUNW,Sun-Fire-V240
JDK version:  1.6.0.21-b06 with 64 bit
EMS version:  EMS6.0.1

The BPM Developer and we reproduced and researched this issue, below is what we found:

Although IPE BG crash, but later the crashed BG thread restart automatic, and run well.
According to analysis the BG and EAIJAVA log, we think this issue is no relationship whit iPE, it should cased by JAVA code.

If this issue is researched  more depth , maybe the developer in CDC need more information about TP11.3, eg. SSL JAVA code.

Thanks

Hi Xiaolei,

As I mentioned last week we need to debug the SSL issue faced with the Solaris 10 env with Tech Plugin 11.3 .
You need to downgrade one of your Solaris boxes to the version which did not work: I think it was Generic_142909-17

Can you check if IT can lend another Solaris box downgraded to this patch so that you can do a fresh setup on that machine and test again?

We can start this exercise after you complete Alpha1 testing tomorrow since we are getting A2 only by next week.
