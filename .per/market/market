EWP REMOVAL FROM MARKET:
================================
	Earlier this year we informally announced that we are no longer marketing the JBoss Enterprise Web Platform (EWP). Effective June 1:
	1. EWP will be disabled in all worldwide direct and channel price lists.
	2. Existing EWP customers will be encouraged to renew with JBoss Enterprise Application Platform SKUs.
	3. EWP 5.x will continue to be supported in accordance with the stated maintenance policies presented here 
(https://access.redhat.com/support/policy/updates/jboss_notes/ )
	4. All references to JBoss Enterprise Web Platform will be removed from our websites on or before June 20, 2012.

RATIONALE:
=========
	 EWP was released into the marketplace as a means to provide enterprise customers with a lighter weight alternative 
to full Java EE application servers. However, a number of market changes have reduced customer demand for this type of solution.
	1. The new architecture of EAP6 combined with a simplified Java EE6 specification has blurred the line between fully certified EE6 
servers and other lightweight technologies (like Tomcat). This has reduced the need for 3 different JBoss application server distributions.
	2. The Java Web Profile specification (the specification upon which EWP is based) has changed over time due to decisions 
made by Oracle after the acquisition of Sun. These changes have in many ways stymied adoption of the web profile.
	3. The cost differential between EAP and EWP was small and many customers when presented with the higher functionality 
for a minimal cost were willing to buy EAP.
